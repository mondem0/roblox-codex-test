# Roblox Tower Defense Kit

This repository contains Luau scripts and configuration modules for a complete tower defense prototype. Each section below explains **exactly** where to place the files inside Roblox Studio, how to assemble the map, and how to wire up the gameplay systems.

## File Placement Guide

Create the folders in **Explorer** exactly as listed. If a folder already exists, reuse it. All scripts are plain `Script` or `LocalScript` objects unless noted otherwise.

### ReplicatedStorage
1. Create a `Folder` named `Modules`.
2. Inside `Modules`, add a `Folder` named `Config`.
3. Insert a `ModuleScript` named **`TowerConfigs`** and paste the contents of [`ReplicatedStorage/Modules/Config/TowerConfigs.lua`](ReplicatedStorage/Modules/Config/TowerConfigs.lua).
4. Insert a `ModuleScript` named **`EnemyConfigs`** and paste the contents of [`ReplicatedStorage/Modules/Config/EnemyConfigs.lua`](ReplicatedStorage/Modules/Config/EnemyConfigs.lua).
5. In `Modules`, add a `ModuleScript` named **`PathService`** and paste [`ReplicatedStorage/Modules/PathService.lua`](ReplicatedStorage/Modules/PathService.lua).
6. Create a `Folder` named `Remotes`. You do **not** need to add RemoteEvents manually; [`ServerScriptService/GameManager.server.lua`](ServerScriptService/GameManager.server.lua) will generate them if missing.

### ServerScriptService
1. Add a `Folder` called `Modules`.
2. Inside that folder create two `ModuleScript` objects:
   * **`TowerService`** → [`ServerScriptService/Modules/TowerService.lua`](ServerScriptService/Modules/TowerService.lua)
   * **`WaveService`** → [`ServerScriptService/Modules/WaveService.lua`](ServerScriptService/Modules/WaveService.lua)
3. Add a `Script` named **`GameManager`** in `ServerScriptService` and paste [`ServerScriptService/GameManager.server.lua`](ServerScriptService/GameManager.server.lua).

### StarterPlayerScripts
1. Inside `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts`, insert a `LocalScript` named **`TowerClient`**.
2. Paste [`StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/TowerClient.client.lua`](StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/TowerClient.client.lua).

The UI shown in the client script is intentionally minimalist. You are free to restyle or replace it with your own ScreenGui, provided you keep the same object names (`Shop`, `Status`, etc.) or adapt the script accordingly.

## Map Construction Instructions

Follow these steps to build the play area quickly:

1. **Workspace Root**: Create a `Model` named **`Map`**. All map parts go inside this model.
2. **Ground**: Insert a `Part` named `PathGround`. Resize it to roughly `200 × 1 × 200`, anchor it, color it a muted green or brown. This part is used for placement validation; you may also split it into multiple parts if you keep them grouped inside a `Model` named `PathGround`.
3. **Enemy Path**: Inside `Map`, add a `Folder` named **`Path`**. Create numbered `Part` objects (`1`, `2`, `3`, …, `10`). Place them above the ground to trace the path. Make each part a small anchored neon block (`Size = 2 × 2 × 2`) that floats just above the ground. Enemies will lerp between these points in numeric order.
   * Suggested layout: form a gentle zig-zag. Start near one corner of the map, cross the field in 8–10 segments, and end near the opposite corner.
4. **Spawn & Exit**:
   * Add a `Part` named **`EnemySpawn`**. Place it just before waypoint `1`. Make sure its orientation points toward waypoint `1` (`LookVector` alignment).
   * Add a `Part` named **`Exit`** at the end of the path (after the last waypoint). Players lose lives when enemies reach this position.
5. **Player Spawn**: Add a `Part` named **`PlayerSpawn`** somewhere safe off the track. The server teleports players here when they spawn.
6. **Cosmetics**: Add any decorative terrain, cliffs, props, or obstacles. Keep towers’ buildable surface open and flat.
7. **Collision**: Anchor every static part. Ensure the path waypoints themselves are set to `Transparency = 1` and `CanCollide = false` so players and towers do not bump into them.

## Gameplay Overview

* **Towers**: Archer (rapid single-target), Cannon (area splash), Frost Mage (slow + damage). Each tower includes two upgrade tiers with distinct stat boosts.
* **Enemies**: Grunts (balanced), Runners (fast, low HP), Tanks (slow, high HP). Defeating enemies awards cash for all players.
* **Waves**: Five handcrafted waves. The system automatically starts the next wave when the current one clears. Players can also press the `Start` button before wave 1.
* **Economy & Lives**: Players begin with $350 and 30 lives. Lives decrease when enemies reach the exit. Losing all lives ends the game for everyone; clearing every wave triggers victory.

## Testing Checklist

1. Publish the game or run **Play** in Studio.
2. Confirm the UI appears with tower buttons, money, lives, wave counter, and a `Start` button.
3. Click a tower button, position the preview over the ground, and click to place it. Towers should appear under the `workspace.Towers` folder.
4. Start the waves. Enemies spawn at `EnemySpawn`, follow your waypoint path, and take damage from towers.
5. Verify money updates when enemies are defeated, and that lives decrease when an enemy reaches the exit.
6. Upgrade a placed tower via code modifications (optional enhancement: add upgrade UI wired to `Remotes.TowerUpgradeRequested`).

Enjoy customizing the visuals, adding sound effects, or expanding with new towers and waves!
